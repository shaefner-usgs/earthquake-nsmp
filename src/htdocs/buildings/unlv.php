<p>The Science and Engineering Building at the University of Nevada Las Vegas
  (UNLV) campus has been recently instrumented for earthquake monitoring by the
  National Strong Motion Project (NSMP) of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in
  collaboration with the UNLV&rsquo;s Department of Civil and Environmental
  Engineering and Construction. This is the first building in Las Vegas
  furnished with a sophisticated seismic monitoring system to monitor its
  structural integrity in near real-time. The monitoring systems, combining
  sensing technologies with an on-site computer, show how earthquakes affect
  the structure, providing invaluable information that can be used to judge
  the safety of the building after an event and to design safer structures in
  the future.</p>

  <p>The Science and Engineering Building, located on the north side of the
    UNLV campus, is a state-of-the-art facility designed for interdisciplinary
    research and education.</p>
</div>

<p>The UNLV Science and Engineering Building instrumentation is more unique than
  any building instrumented before. This particular structure has been awarded
  the Silver rating by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)
  program. In order to obtain a LEED rating, the building must meet
  environmentally responsible and sustainable design, construction, and
  operation standards.</p>

<p>This is the first environmentally friendly building instrumented by the NSMP,
  and the only building monitored for earthquake shaking in Las Vegas. The
  intention of instrumenting this particular steel building is to see how
  buildings that are designed with the environment in mind, hold up to the
  strong lateral forces created by earthquakes. It is intended to use the
  obtained data from the sensors and the building to improve on environmentally
  friendly designs.</p>

<h2>USGS Uses Advanced Sensing Technologies</h2>

      in the schematic diagram show the locations and indicate the directional
      sensitivity of the seismic sensors from the first floor through the
      building&rsquo;s four stories to the roof.

<p>The UNLV Science and Engineering Building has a seismic array of 21 motion
  sensors installed. These sensors are strategically located in each floor
  where the maximum building response during a ground shaking is expected,
  mostly at the edges. Every story has at least two seismic motion sensors
  oriented horizontally in two orthogonal directions to detect building motion
  along the reference east-west and north-south directions. Floor rotation
  around the vertical axis can be computed from the recordings of the two
  sensors pointing same direction but located at different points. The building
  also has a triaxial sensor located on the first floor, which records the input
  motions in three orthogonal directions at this level. Specifically, the
  building&rsquo;s instrumentation is designed to record and compute:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The swaying and twisting of the building</li>
  <li>The time it takes seismic waves to travel from the foundations to the roof</li>
  <li>How the frame of the buildings changed during the earthquake</li>
</ul>

<p>Other triaxial seismic motion sensor located away from the building records
  free-field ground shaking without any interference with the building to
  provide input for USGS <a href="/earthquakes/shakemap/">ShakeMaps</a>. These
  graphics depict ground motion and shaking intensity after significant
  earthquakes, giving a visual representation of a quake&rsquo;s behavior and
  impact for emergency response.</p>

<h2>Structural Health Monitoring and Damage Detection</h2>

<p>It is imperative to monitor the condition of UNLV&rsquo;s one of the most
  important buildings in near-real time in order to be able to assess its
  structural integrity immediately after a major catastrophic event. Structural
  health monitoring will be achieved by implementation of an open-source on-site
  data analysis system. This innovative system provides information about how
  buildings move and distort during shaking, and where damage likely occurred.
  Several independent algorithms check for variations in movements of a building
  frame and its vibration characteristics, for travel time of seismic waves
  between foundation and roof, and for exceedance of the building&rsquo;s
  seismic design capacity.</p>

<p>The obtained real-time data is also available to UNLV&rsquo;s faculty and
  engineering students through an on-site computer to study and understand the
  building&rsquo;s vibration characteristics and response during earthquakes.</p>

    rapidly assess building safety.</p>
